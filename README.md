# 🌟 Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- dbt: [dbt installation guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation)
- git: [git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Next, clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dbt-toolbox-template.git
cd dbt-toolbox-template
```
## 🚀 Local Environment Setup
Follow these easy steps to set up your local environment for executing dbt commands!

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
```
Python 3.10
Pipenv 2023.2.18
```
Install Pipenv using the command:
```bash
pip install pipenv==2023.2.18
```
📁 Create profiles.yml
Create a file in the project root named profiles.yml. For example, if you are using GoogleCloudPlatform BigQuery, you could follow the next steps. For other definitions, check the specifications. 

Add the following content to the file:
```yaml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account
      project: <YOUR_BQ_PROJECT>
      schema: dbt_<NAME>
      location: EU
      keyfile: <PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON>
```
Replace <YOUR_BQ_PROJECT>, <NAME>, and <PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON> with your custom values.

### 🌐 Create .env
Create a file in the project root named .env.

Add the following environment variables:
```makefile
Copy code
DBT_PROFILES_DIR=.
DBT_ENVIRONMENT=dev
DBT_GCS_BUCKET=dev
```
🐍 Set up the Python Environment
Create the Python environment by installing the Pipfile from the project directory:
```bash
pipenv install --dev
```
Access the environment from the project directory:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

For more commands, simply check pipenv -h.

### 💻 IDE Setup
To enhance your development experience and work similarly to DBT Cloud, we recommend using Visual Studio Code and installing the following plugin:

dbt Power User: Follow the settings steps provided by the plugin.

## 🌍 Environment Capabilities

With the profiles.yml file, you can configure multiple environments for your dbt projects, such as development, staging, and production. This powerful feature allows you to manage different settings and target databases seamlessly.

For more information on setting up environments, check out the [dbt documentation on profiles](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile).

## 🧰 Macros
The macros/ folder is packed with reusable macros to automate common tasks and transformations. Organized into subfolders based on functionality, you can easily find and import macros into your dbt project:

```sql
{% import 'macros/your_macro_name.sql' as your_macro %}
```
## 🧪 Tests
The tests/ folder contains an extensive set of custom data tests to validate your data models. Implement these tests by adding them to the schema.yml file of the corresponding model:
```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: your_model
    columns:
      - name: your_column
        tests:
          - your_custom_test_name:
              arg1: value1
              arg2: value
```
## 💡 SQL Code Snippets
The sql_snippets/ folder houses a collection of useful SQL code snippets designed specifically for dbt. Sorted into subfolders based on functionality, you can effortlessly integrate these snippets into your SQL code.
## 🗂️ DB Compatibility
This dbt toolbox is designed to work seamlessly with a variety of databases, including:

- PostgreSQL
- BigQuery
- Snowflake
- Redshift
- Apache Spark

Simply configure your profiles.yml file to connect to your desired database, and the toolbox will adapt accordingly.

## 🔍 dbt Insights
dbt (data build tool) is a powerful open-source data transformation tool that enables data engineers and analysts to perform complex data modeling using SQL. By leveraging the power of dbt, you can:
- Write modular, reusable code: dbt's native support for Jinja templating allows you to create macros and snippets that can be reused across your projects.
- Automate tasks: With a rich collection of macros, you can automate repetitive tasks and build efficient, scalable data pipelines.
- Perform data validation: Validate the quality of your data using custom tests, ensuring that your data models are accurate and reliable.
- Optimize SQL code: dbt's powerful SQL code snippets are specifically tailored for data transformation, allowing you to write optimized, high-performance queries.
- Collaborate: dbt projects follow a clear structure, making it easy for team members to collaborate, share code, and maintain consistent coding standards.
- Adapt to different databases: dbt seamlessly integrates with various databases, enabling you to switch between different data platforms without altering your project structure.
